Marquise Francis,2022-08-25T15:57:58.000Z,Oklahoma is set to execute its first of more than two dozen death row inmates over the next 29 months. But given the state’s complicated history with...,Yahoo News,"Beginning Thursday, Oklahoma is set to execute its first of more than two dozen death row inmates over the next 29 months — an average of one execution per month over the next two years. If carried out in full, the unprecedented number of 25 executions would put to death ,, who include a flurry of incarcerated individuals with mental health disorders and others who have maintained their innocence.,Given the state’s , with executions, which includes , and a , of death row inmates, legal experts and critics alike are perplexed by its fervor to kill so many people in such a short amount of time.,“Why the rush to execute 25 people?” Tracy Hresko Pearl, a professor at the University of Oklahoma College of Law, queried in an interview with Yahoo News, calling 25 executions in two years “horrifying.”,James Coddington was the first inmate to be executed and died on Thursday morning. Coddington, who had been in jail since 1997 for killing a friend who refused to loan him $50 to buy cocaine, was , by Republican Gov. Kevin Stitt on Wednesday, despite the Oklahoma Pardon and Parole Board recommending him for clemency earlier this month. Coddington repeatedly expressed remorse for the murder, and his lawyers said he had worked to turn his life around for the better behind bars — all to no avail.,“Oklahoma views its criminal justice system as, No. 1, infallible and, No. 2, punitive, above all else,” Pearl said. “I think that the advent of DNA evidence has really shown us how often we get cases, and even very serious capital cases, wrong.”,In fact, according to the , by the National Registry of Exonerations, somewhere between 2% and 10% of all convicted individuals in U.S. prisons are innocent — a stat that many legal experts argue is far too high to legitimize capital punishment for anyone. , by the registry in 2020 found that more than half of the wrongful criminal convictions are caused by government misconduct, which rarely faces consequences.,“Misconduct by police, prosecutors and other law enforcement officials is a regular problem and it produces a steady stream of ,, an emeritus professor at the University of Michigan Law School and a co-founder of the registry, told the Washington Post.,It’s an ugly truth that many have paid for with their life, while others have paid financially.,State capital cases, or death penalty proceedings, cost state taxpayers 3.2 times more than non-capital cases on average, according to a ,. More revealing, an analysis of 15 death penalty cases nationwide, from that same study, determined that seeking the death penalty results in an average of approximately $700,000 more in costs than not seeking death.,Complicating the death penalty’s implementation, certified physicians are barred from participating in the practice. The , in 2006 announced that any physician who participates in an execution violates their Hippocratic oath to protect lives. As a result, the state goes to extreme lengths to administer executions. Earlier this year it was revealed that Oklahoma paid a doctor , (to check consciousness, verify the drugs being used and ultimately confirm death), plus another $1,000 a day for training. The high financial burden, coupled with various moral and efficacy dilemmas associated with state-sanctioned executions, presents a serious cause for concern for many critics.,“My hope is always that the state views the goal of its criminal justice system to be truth above all else,” Pearl said. “And I think that when a state rushes to execute a large number of people, what it’s doing is something very different than pursuing truth. It’s pursuing punishment above all else. And I think that should be incredibly disturbing for all Americans.”,Another concern for legal experts is transparency around where the ingredients that make up lethal injections for Oklahoma executions come from, something they say has always been shrouded in secrecy. Readily available information online details a three-drug method, which is the ,: a barbiturate that acts as a sedative and painkiller, a drug that causes paralysis such as vecuronium bromide and a dose of potassium chloride to stop the heart.,No information about where the drugs are obtained or their efficacy is publicly available. The Oklahoma Department of Corrections, which is in charge of carrying out the executions, did not respond to multiple requests for comment from Yahoo News.,Andrea Digilio Miller, legal director of the Oklahoma Innocence Project, an organization dedicated to finding and resolving wrongful conviction cases in the state based at the Oklahoma City University School of Law, believes more transparency in the entire execution process would allow Americans to have more informed views on the death penalty. In its absence, she says, many are left to think the worst.,“Who are we getting our [lethal injection] drugs from?” Miller probed in an interview with Yahoo News. “If these aren’t drugs that are really available on the open market, where are they coming from? And are they expired? I think those are the sorts of things that people should know so that it can inform their individual beliefs about the death penalty.”,Having spent more than two decades as a public defender in Oklahoma, Miller has at least six former clients who are on the list of 25 death row inmates slated to be executed in the next two years. Among those names was Coddington.,For Miller, given Oklahoma’s deeply conservative values, which are anti-abortion and include having the , in the country, the championing of the death penalty seems to go directly against the basic idea of preservation of life.,“We in this country talk so much about trying to protect children while they’re children, but then for the children who slipped in the cracks and the system doesn’t help, we’re more than willing to throw them away on the back end when they make a mistake,” she said. “And that’s very much what the James Coddington story is.”,“He came from abject poverty. He came from a very abusive background and a background where everybody in his life had substance abuse problems,” she added. “And every death row inmate I have ever represented suffered from the consequences of that type of trauma.”,In spite of advocates’ best efforts to delegitimize the death penalty in Oklahoma, the reality is that executions have been the law of the land in the state for more than two centuries. Capital punishment was , there in 1804 when Congress made criminal laws in the U.S. applicable to lands acquired in the Louisiana Purchase, which include present-day Oklahoma. At the time, only “willful murder” was punishable by the death penalty. Since then, Congress has expanded the scope to include several other offenses, including treason, espionage and rape.,The original death penalty law called for executions to be carried out by electric chair, but the Supreme Court deemed that ,. The current ,, enacted in 1977, calls for executions to be carried out by lethal injection. From 1915 to 2022, Oklahoma has executed a total of 196 men and three women, according to the ,.,But they haven’t all gone as planned.,In 2014, Oklahoma death row inmate Clayton Lockett , for more than 40 minutes during his execution before suffering a heart attack. Just months later, another inmate, Charles Warner, complained, “,,” according to witnesses, as he was killed. Then just last year, inmate John Grant, , as he lay on the gurney before he died, drawing sharp criticism for the practice.,Richard Glossip, one of the 25 death row inmates scheduled to be executed, will likely eat his , on death row. In 2015, just as he was set to be injected with the lethal cocktail, officials realized they had the wrong drug, sparing his life. Having always , for a killing he was accused of, Glossip is hoping a last-minute appeal works in his favor.,Instead of Oklahoma leadership slowing down executions as numerous issues arise, the process and quantity are just picking up.,“Oklahoma did not execute anyone for over 6 years and 9 months, from mid-January of 2015 until late October of 2021,” Maria T. Kolar, an assistant professor of law at Oklahoma City University School of Law who teaches courses about criminal law and capital punishment, told Yahoo News in an email. “In an era when executions are at a new low nationwide for the modern era — for so many reasons — it seems reasonable to ask whether Oklahoma really wants to ‘lead the nation’ when it comes to executions.”","Oklahoma readies for 25 executions in 2 years.

An additional $10,000 in forgiveness goes to those who received need-based Pell Grants.,Biden also extended the pandemic forbearance on federal student loans to December 31, helping those who didn't make the forgiveness cut or who would still have an outstanding balance after forgiveness. The administration also laid out other steps to reduce the education cost burden for existing and future borrowers.,The latest move delivers on Biden’s campaign promise for student debt relief and could help up to 43 million borrowers, according to the administration.,An erasure of $10,000 for all borrowers with federally-backed loans would cost roughly $371 billion and eliminate loans for about a third of borrowers. While the $125,000 income cap reduces the cost and scope, 90% of the relief goes to households with $75,000 in yearly income or less, according to figures from the Department of Education.,""No individual making more than $125,000 or household making more than $250,000 – the top , of incomes in the United States – will receive relief,"" the fact sheet provided by the administration stated.,With $10,000 in forgiveness, “you're going to reach a lot more borrowers that are at significant risk of default,” Antoinette Flores, director of postsecondary education at the Center for American Progress (CAP), t,. “We know that the majority of borrowers who ended up defaulting have debt below $10,000.”,The additional $10,000 for Pell Grant recipients also further helps the more finanially vulnerable. According to the administration fact sheet, Pell Grant recipients account for more than 60% of the borrower population and nearly all come from a family that earns less than $60,000 a year.,""The potential of an extra $10,000 worth of forgiveness for some Pell Grant Recipients was unexpected, but it makes sense given that it directly targets lower income borrowers and runs contrary to the narrative that student loan forgiveness is a 'handout to the rich,' as some have argued,"" Jacob Channel, senior economist at Student Loan Hero, said in a statement.,Additionally, Biden is extending the payment pause to the end of the year. The relief originally was set to ,. The extension will provide temporary relief for the remaining borrowers who are ineligible for forgiveness or who will receive limited relief from the elimination of $10,000 in debt.,The pause is the final extension after originally enacted,at the beginning of the pandemic in March 2020 to help borrowers who were facing financial troubles such as job loss or furloughs.,It has been extended seven times collectively by both administrations, and some experts said it was necessary to extend forbearance again this time around as borrowers and servicers were not ,.,""In keeping with my campaign promise, my Administration is announcing a plan to give working and middle class families breathing room as they prepare to resume federal student loan payments in January 2023,"" the president tweeted.,The Education Department is also proposing a rule to cap monthly payments for undergraduate loans at 5% of a borrower’s discretionary income, which is half the rate borrowers pay now under most plans.

Mike Bebernes,2022-08-03T14:27:45.000Z,Polls suggest a large share of the voting public is eager for a viable alternative to the two major parties. So why isn't there one?,Yahoo News,"Dozens of former Republicans and Democrats announced last week that they had , aimed at attracting the support of voters who have become dissatisfied with America’s two major political parties.,The party, called Forward, is led by former Democratic presidential candidate Andrew Yang alongside former Republican New Jersey Gov. Christine Todd Whitman and ex-GOP lawmaker David Jolly. In an op-ed for , describing their vision, the trio described Forward as a “unifying political party for the majority of Americans who want to move past divisiveness and reject extremism.”,Attempts to establish a viable third party that can meaningfully compete with Democrats and Republicans are not new, but none of those efforts have been able to break the dominance of the two parties. It’s been , since a third-party presidential candidate has won any electoral votes. The most successful modern candidate from outside the two major parties was Ross Perot, who received nearly 19% of votes while running as an independent in 1992.,The two major parties also hold near-unanimous command over Congress. Each of the 431 current members of the House of Representatives is from one of the two parties. There are two independents in the Senate, though both consistently vote with the Democrats, and one, Bernie Sanders of Vermont, has run for the Democratic presidential nomination.,Forward’s leaders are aware of this history but argue that a huge share of Americans “feel they aren’t represented” by the two major parties — which they say creates room for a moderate third party to step in and make a difference.,Though they acknowledge that it’s a very steep climb, some experts believe the current environment may be ripe for a third party — even if it’s not Forward — to have a substantive impact on American politics. A Gallup poll early last year found a record 62% of voters believe the two major parties are doing such a poor job that an ,. While they concede it may be far-fetched to imagine a third-party candidate making a legitimate challenge for the presidency in 2024, optimists argue there is opportunity for outside groups to be competitive in local races and build a solid foundation that allows them to gradually increase their influence over time.,But skeptics say the challenges are simply too steep for any third party to break through. Beyond the enormous financial and infrastructure advantages the major parties enjoy, America’s “winner-take-all” system of government can make it impossible for third parties to hold any real governing power. Critics also say polling on suggesting a widespread desire for a third party can be misleading. They say that while there are plenty of discontented voters, they are spread so disparately across the ideological spectrum that no one party could possibly represent all of their varying views. There’s also the “spoiler” problem, in which third parties tend to siphon off votes from the major party they’re most closely aligned with, which can ultimately help the party they most oppose win close races. For example, voters who supported Green Party candidates Ralph Nader in 2000 and Jill Stein in 2016 have been blamed — fairly or not — by some Democrats for helping the GOP win the presidency in both those elections.,Some political analysts, though, say the impact of third parties shouldn’t be judged solely by whether they win elections. They argue that there are plenty of examples in history when a third party gained enough support that one of the major parties was compelled to make a substantial policy shift in response. A centrist third party could have a similar effect today, some argue, by forcing either Democrats or Republicans to moderate their approach if they fear too many voters will abandon them.,Forward is planning to hold its first party convention next summer and aims to have candidates on the ballot in local and state-level races across the country in 2024. Party leaders say there are currently no plans to run a presidential candidate during that election cycle.,“No matter the exact percentage of disaffected moderates, it seems certain that were a centrist coalition or political vehicle to arise in service of ‘bipartisan’ policy objectives, it would shift the political center of gravity and find itself constituting a majority, or at least be sufficiently substantial to deny one to the political extremes (or the legacy political parties animated by them).” — Richard J. Shinder, ,“Our two-party system exists not because Americans want just two parties. They definitively want more. But our antiquated ‘first-past-the-post’ system of voting, where the candidate with the most vote wins, renders third parties as spoilers and thus directs all political ambition to the two major parties, entrenching the two-party system.” — Lee Drutman, ,“In the United States, a successful third party isn’t necessarily one that wins national office. Instead, a successful third party is one that integrates itself or its program into one of the two major parties, either by forcing key issues onto the agenda or revealing the existence of a potent new electorate.” — Jamelle Bouie, ,“Ultimately, the purported constituents for a centrist third party aren’t as large a group as is often imagined and aren’t really centrists, either. And their alienation from both parties may be more about alienation from politics or, to put it another way, from the prospect of doing anything about their grievances. This fantasy will never die, but it’s not springing into real life in the foreseeable future.” — Ed Kilgore, ,“Americans consistently voice growing distrust in the federal government, greater faith in local government, and an increasing preference that states take the lead over D.C. in setting policy. … Reviving federalism and localism could be more appealing to voters than yet another empty assertion that, deep down, we all favor 'commonsense solutions' that strike many people as nothing of the sort.” — J.D. Tuccille, ,“Any single new party tends to divide the ranks of one of the existing parties — whichever is closer to its political philosophy. … On the other hand, if two or even three new parties tried to form at once, the result could be unpredictable and fluid.” — Quin Hillyer, ,“Favoritism for party candidates is a tough mountain to climb. Even voters who might consider independent or third-party candidates often decide that they do not want to waste their vote, and they will choose a candidate from one of the two major parties as the lesser of two evils. Americans prefer to vote for a candidate they believe can win.” — Kevin Wagner, ,“The 2024 presidential election may be a good opportunity for an independent campaign. It’s implausible that such a candidate would win the presidency, but making enough noise to be noticed isn’t rare. … If President Joe Biden remains unpopular and continues running for another term well into 2023, that would set up the same circumstance.” — Jonathan Bernstein, ,“In this climate — where large factions of party members regard the other party as not just wrong, but evil — the idea of a new entity drawing discontented voters from the center of both parties seems a heavy reach.” — Jeff Greenfield, ,“A non-Trumpy candidate could play the role of spoiler by garnering enough conservative votes in the general election to throw the election to the Democrat. … The point is to cause the GOP some pain for its descent into asininity. … It would also serve to remind the GOP that if you abandon conservative principles, conservatives might abandon you.” — Jonah Goldberg, ,“It would take tens if not hundreds of millions of dollars to establish an organization capable of challenging the Big Two, they’ve learned — think mom-and-pop startup challenging Coke and Pepsi — and existing political donors are generally locked into one side of the aisle or the other. So are the vast majority of political professionals who would risk their careers to aid in the creation of a major new national party. Like it or not, inside American politics, you’re on one side or the other. There is no in between.” — William F. B. O'Reilly, ,“Real politics requires you to not just say ‘Gee, wouldn’t it be great if everything was better?’ but to make hard choices, choices that will make some people mad. It means risky stands on principle and tradeoffs and imperfect solutions and fights. If you aren’t willing to take all that on, you aren’t serious about politics.” — Paul Waldman, ,Photo illustration: Yahoo News; photos: Angela Weiss/AFP via Getty Images",Is there any room for a 3rd party in American politics?,https://news.yahoo.com/is-there-any-room-for-a-third-party-in-american-politics-142745823.html

Charles P. Rettig,2022-08-25T13:00:49.000Z,IRS Commissioner Charles Rettig sets the record straight on the Inflation Reduction Act's funding for the agency.,Yahoo News,"As the nation’s tax administrator, the IRS plays a unique role in our nation. It can be a difficult job. After all, does anyone really like paying taxes? Of course not. But they’re essential to fund the roads we drive on, the schools our children attend, support our military and so much more. Unfortunately, given the nature of this work and historical stereotypes, the IRS is often perceived as an easy target for mischaracterizations of what IRS employees do — and that’s exactly what’s happened in recent weeks.,The recent debate over providing badly needed funding to the IRS is filled with outright false suggestions about what the agency and our hard-working employees do — as well as how the additional resources will be handled.,The bottom line is this: These resources are absolutely not about increasing audit scrutiny on small business or middle-income Americans. The investment of these important resources is designed to support honest, compliant taxpayers. Our investment is designed around a Treasury directive that audit rates do not rise relative to recent years for households making under $400,000.,We all want a fair and impartial system where everyone contributes their fair share, no more and certainly no less. A robust, visible tax enforcement effort focused on high-end tax evaders and those supporting them is a priority. Underpayments by tax evaders shift the burden of operating our great country onto honest, hard-working Americans who follow the law.,With this new law, honest taxpayers will see badly needed, meaningful service improvements at the IRS. The IRS should be able to answer the phones and process information — including tax returns — in a timely manner. Enhanced IT systems and taxpayer services will mean that honest taxpayers will be better able to comply with the tax laws, ultimately resulting in a lower — yes, lower — likelihood of being audited and a reduced burden on them.,To set the record straight on this important legislation and dispel any lingering misperceptions, here are some key facts to keep in mind:,: The IRS is hiring 87,000 armed special agents to harass taxpayers., Absolutely false. The majority of new hires the IRS makes will be those who answer the phones, work on processing individual tax returns or go after high-end taxpayers or corporations who are avoiding their taxes. Less than 1% of new hires will be in our IRS Criminal Investigation (IRS-CI) area, which currently has a total of about 2,100 special agents and is currently hiring about 300 more.,These CI special agents investigate criminal tax violations typically related to money laundering, Bank Secrecy, National Security and National Defense matters. They have been involved in dismantling terrorist financing efforts and criminal cartels as well as eliminating child exploitation operations in the Dark Net that led to the arrests of hundreds of people throughout the world. They do not perform civil tax administrative functions such as audits of tax returns. They are law enforcement officers, and every American should be extremely proud they are on our team., All IRS employees — and those being hired under the new legislation — will carry firearms., Again, absolutely false. More than 97% of IRS employees do not carry weapons. This includes key civil-side enforcement personnel, including revenue agents, examiners and others involved in audits and compliance work. Less than 3% of IRS employees — expressly limited to Criminal Investigation special agents — carry firearms. IRS Criminal Investigation oversees the entirety of the work related to criminal violations of the tax law and other financial crimes. This is consistent with other federal law enforcement agencies.,: The additional funding will be used to hire more auditors to “shake down” average taxpayers.,: False. Wage-earning taxpayers like firefighters, construction workers, teachers and police officers are among the most compliant taxpayers, given that their incomes come from Forms W-2 and 1099. These resources are absolutely not about increasing audit scrutiny on small businesses or middle-income Americans. Instead, the additional resources will also be focused on large corporate and high net-worth taxpayers to enforce laws already on the books that the IRS does not have enough resources to pursue.,: The new legislation will be a massive overnight expansion of the IRS.,: False. This funding — which will be spread over 10 years — will add employees over time as we modernize our operations with meaningful technological enhancements. In addition, the IRS has one of the oldest workforces in government, and staffing has been in a deep decline for many years. More than 50,000 employees will retire in the next few years, leaving the foundation of the tax system that the nation relies on at risk. We’ve been losing 10,000 employees a year.,Overall, current IRS staffing is far below historical norms. In 1992, the IRS had 117,000 employees — 38,000 more than today. Back then, the agency was dealing with fewer taxpayers; the U.S. population has grown almost 30% since 1992., This new funding will allow overreach by the IRS, putting agents on every street corner and prying into people’s personal financial lives., False. This funding will allow the IRS to better serve the nation’s taxpayers — and ultimately meet the critical needs of our country. Our employees care and, like others in government, take an oath to support our country. We take pride in hiring veterans, people with disabilities and people from all walks of life and from every corner of our country. Many of our employees, including myself, are members of a military family. And all of our employees reflect the taxpayers we serve.,I am an extremely proud American, a member of a proud military family, and simply will not accept baseless, harmful assertions against the interests of our country and the proud, hard-working employees of the IRS. Everyone should know this about IRS employees: We care, a lot, about this country and you.","IRS sets the record straight: We’re going after tax evaders, not honest Americans: Op-Ed",https://news.yahoo.com/irs-sets-the-record-straight-130049197.html

And one energy trader says prices at the pump are set move higher again – especially into the fall and winter months.,Rebecca Babin, senior energy trader at CIBC Private Wealth, ,, two things will put upward pressure on gas prices: reserves and sanctions.,“Even if demand dips [for gasoline], supply will dip with it, and I don’t see a significant pullback,” Babin said. “If anything, I think that gasoline prices on the national average will probably rise from here.”,First, Babin notes the Biden administration’s release of oil reserves from the Strategic Petroleum Reserve is set to end in November. Second, Europe is due to increase sanctions on Russia in December. Both could cut oil supply, pushing prices higher and rippling through to gasoline.,All of this will coincide with heating oil season in North America. Besides seasonal demand for the fuel, it’s more profitable for refiners to produce than gasoline, Babin said, so they’ll be more inclined to make crude into heating oil.,The recent decline in gasoline prices has given a ,, although the correlation to consumer spending has been ,. And still, retail gasoline remains 23 percent higher than this time last year.,Underlying WTI crude oil has been rebounding from its low around $86.50 last week, following a two-month slide that coincided with the bounce in stock prices. The rise was further fanned Tuesday by , that indicated the oil-rich nation would be willing to cut production to support prices.,“Saudi Arabia was sending a little reminder note to both the markets and the United States that they are the central banker to crude, and they can make market-moving decisions,” Babin said. Babin noted these comments also reassured oil traders concerned a potential Iran nuclear deal would lead to more oil supply on the market and depress prices.,Babin is not alone in her view that crude oil prices will rise into the end of the year.

Rick Newman,2022-08-24T16:15:44.000Z,Biden's executive order forgiving some student debt raises genuine fairness issues. What else should the government pay off?,Yahoo News,"President Biden doesn’t want to do it. But political reality has compelled him to make the biggest move so far to relieve student borrowers of onerous debt.,After months of deliberation, Biden , that will forgive up to $10,000 of student debt for borrowers earning less than $125,000 per year. Those with federal Pell grants, which go to those with exceptional financial need, will receive up to $20,000 in forgiveness if they make less than $125,000.,As a presidential candidate in 2020, Biden supported ,, in contrast with other Democrats who wanted to write off much or all of the $1.6 trillion in student debt Americans hold. Biden also opposed debt relief by executive order, saying Congress should do it by passing a law that leaves no doubt about the legality of the move.,The votes aren’t there for Congress to pass a debt-relief law, and Democrats need every advantage they can get heading into this year’s midterm elections. So Biden is holding his nose while signing a debt-relief executive order likely to face legal challenges. Biden has also extended a moratorium on student-debt repayment for the eighth time since March 2020, when Congress first enacted a repayment pause as part of the COVID-relief CARES Act. That pause now extends to Dec. 31.,The White House undoubtedly conducted detailed analysis to figure out how to provide some debt forgiveness, which is popular among Democrats, while triggering the least blowback from nanny-state critics. The $10,000 limit may be the optimal move. Polling shows ,. Support declines as the dollar amount gets larger, with only 41% supporting the elimination of all student debt, which is what uber-liberal Sen. Bernie Sanders of Vermont wants to do. Not surprisingly, support for debt relief is much higher among people who actually hold student debt.,Any debt relief at all, however, is a questionable use of taxpayer dollars. Forgiving $10,000 of debt will , and reduce the balance for about 30 million others. But it will cost the government about $300 billion in foregone revenue, according to the ,. That will add to budget deficits and , the $275 billion in deficit reduction included in the so-called Inflation Reduction Act that President Biden signed less than two weeks ago.,It might make sense for the government to spend $300 billion on a social benefit. Congress approves such spending on a regular basis. But policymakers starting from scratch with $300 billion at their disposal would probably never opt for student debt relief. As ,, the majority of the benefit will accrue to borrowers in the top 60% of the income distribution. The $125,000 income ceiling underscores the problem. Median household income is ,, which means some beneficiaries of the debt cancellation will earn nearly twice as much as the typical family.,Social programs that do the most good are typically targeted at lower-income people who need the most help. The best economic return, in terms of reducing poverty, would probably come from expanding the child tax credit, helping lower-income workers with child care costs or providing paid leave for workers whose employers don’t provide it. But Democrats in Congress don’t have the votes to enact such programs and Biden can’t do it through executive order.,Student-debt cancellation also raises legitimate fairness questions. It does nothing to help Americans without any college education, who typically earn less than those who attended college. There’s no benefit for college grads who worked their way through school or took out loans and repaid them.,Some taxpayers will strenuously object to debt relief for borrowers who could have made other choices, such as borrowing less and working part-time during school, attending a cheaper community college or even opting for a trade school with a direct pathway to a well-paying job. What about some relief for people struggling with credit-card debt at a 30% interest rate? If the government bails out college grads, why doesn’t it pay off my mortgage? Or my small-business loan? Why doesn’t Uncle Sam just buy everybody a BMW? They’re not wrong.,None of this is meant to dismiss the legitimate difficulty millions of student borrowers have paying off loans that have mushroomed far beyond what their incomes can manage. The federal student-lending program has morphed from a helpful stepping stone to education into a monstrosity rife with unintended consequences. The government offers easy money with essentially no evaluation of borrowers’ creditworthiness or ability to repay the money. There’s no metric for calculating return-on-investment. Young borrowers with no financial experience basically indenture themselves with little or no awareness of what they’re committing to. Vast federal subsidies, meanwhile, have helped push college tuition to unimaginable levels, making the whole problem even worse.,Prudent reform might pair debt forgiveness with structural changes such as providing better financial education to borrowers, holding college responsible for job placement or other outcomes, and doing something to bring college tuition down. Some would sharply curtail the federal student-aid program and return it to the private sector, where lenders would do proper underwriting and only lend money they think borrowers can reasonably pay back.,None of that is in Biden’s executive order, and Democrats may drop the whole issue once the midterms are past. Biden himself probably hopes he’s doing just enough to win a few votes for his fellow Democrats in November, and not quite enough to trigger a voter revolt.",Where’s the debt relief for everybody else?,https://news.yahoo.com/wheres-the-debt-relief-for-everybody-else-161544802.html

(Reuters) - California is about to launch an experiment to cover aqueducts with solar panels, a plan that if scaled up might save billions of gallons of otherwise evaporated water while powering millions of homes.,Project Nexus in the Turlock Irrigation District launches in mid-October amid Western North America's worst drought in 1,200 years and as human-influenced climate change exacerbates the dry spell.,The $20 million project, funded by the state, is due to break ground in two locations. One is a 500-foot (152-meter or about 0.3-mile) span along a curved portion of the canal in the town of Hickman, about 100 miles (160 km) inland from San Francisco. The other is a mile-long (1.6-km long) straightaway in nearby Ceres.,Based on a similar project in the west Indian state of Gujarat, the project is the first of its kind in the United States, said University of California Merced project scientist Brandi McKuin. The Turlock project was inspired by a research paper McKuin published in 2021.,Modern California was built thanks to 20th century infrastructure that delivers water from the wet north to the arid south, a network McKuin said now totals 4,000 miles (6,400 km) of canals.,Covering those canals with solar panels would reduce evaporation, avoid using other land for solar farms and reduce aquatic weed and algae growth, saving on maintenance costs, McKuin said.,""It's really exciting to test our hypothesis and the paper we published.

The New Voice of Ukraine,2022-08-25T12:31:00.000Z,"Six months ago, Russia launched a full-scale invasion of Ukraine. Since then, Russia has occupied 13% more of the country, killed thousands of Ukrainians...",Yahoo News,"Russian soldiers have committed unspeakable war crimes and thousands of Ukrainian children have been forcibly relocated to Russia. One-third of Ukrainians have ,, sparking the largest refugee crisis since World War II.,Back in February, I was one of the few analysts who , Moscow to invade. Most remained skeptical in spite of Washington’s full-throated insistence and intelligence that an invasion was looming. The first six months of the war have continued to challenge assumptions. These are the six biggest surprises to me. ,Diplomacy failed, US threats flopped (US President Joe Biden even , outlining the US response to an invasion), and a beefed-up NATO presence in Eastern Europe before the invasion did nothing. The international system is now failing Ukraine in seeking justice for war crimes and restitution for billions in damage. Even after six months of war, the West has nothing real to offer Ukraine in terms of permanent security guarantees. ,The Russian army has a long history of brutal violence, but it seemed unthinkable that soldiers would engage in the mass rape, torture and killing of civilians whom the Russian regime officially considers their Slavic brothers. And yet this is exactly what they did in towns and villages on the outskirts of Kyiv. Russia’s deliberate bombing of a theater in Mariupol that was known to be sheltering women and children defies belief.,As Andrii Osadchuk, a Ukrainian MP with the Holos party recently reminded me, it previously seemed unthinkable that the Russian army would eliminate Russian-speaking village after village in southeastern Ukraine, thereby destroying its own political stronghold in the country. Russia’s actions in southeast Ukraine alone expose the myth of Slavic brotherhood., ,President Biden didn’t ask the American public to do anything beyond pay higher prices at the pump. He has done a ton for Ukraine, and he and his team deserve huge credit for many things, but messaging to the public isn’t one of them., for elites in the , explaining what the US will and will not do in Ukraine isn’t enough. It’s not quite as bad as when President George W. Bush told the American public to go shopping after 9/11, but Biden’s inattention to messaging to the American public doesn’t get high marks.,Russia’s war in Ukraine will be long and drawn out. The outcome of the war depends on how long the West will sustain the effort with weapons and financial support. It all hinges on public opinion in the end. The lack of public messaging during the first six months of the war is a shame because Biden has an extraordinary gift for connecting with average people and fervently believes in the cause of freedom.,Less than a year ago, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy came to Washington for a visit. I , why he bothered with no real achievements to show. He was trying to boost investment in Ukraine without engaging in the real work of reform. In his first two years in office (2019-2021), he showed little interest in the often boring and complicated details of policy, opting instead for quick fixes. Rather than overhaul the courts, he flirted with the idea of investment nannies who would help Western businesses if they encountered any problems with Ukraine’s notorious law enforcement and legal systems.,He began the war by rejecting overtures to leave Kyiv and govern from western Ukraine or Poland. He has since inspired the world with his personal heroism and courage while brow beating Western governments to do more and explaining to the world the price of freedom.,As a war leader, Zelenskyy has a reputation for respecting his generals and leaving the big strategic decisions up to them. He has also become a staunch defender of Ukraine. During his 2019 presidential election campaign, many people questioned Zelenskyy’s patriotism and commitment to Ukraine. Up until February 24, he showed willingness to compromise and negotiate to end the war. No longer.,The Kremlin never understood how much Ukraine fundamentally changed since the country’s 2014 Euromaidan Revolution. Moscow failed to grasp that the reforms put in place over the past eight years were genuine, however haltingly they were implemented. This was especially true in terms of military reforms.,As Daniel Szeligowski at the Polish Institute of International Affairs ,, Russians completely misinterpreted polling data from Ukraine showing that Ukrainians disliked their political authorities but trusted the country’s military. This led to the disastrous conclusion in Moscow that if Russia could wipe out the Ukrainian military, Ukrainians would be glad to accept new leaders. How wrong they were.,Ukraine is not a failed state. Six months after the start of the Russian invasion, Ukraine’s banking system continues to work. Ukraine pays public sector workers on time. Hospitals and schools still function. The state railway moved millions of Ukrainians out of harm’s way. Central election data was closed and moved abroad to protect it from Russian hackers. Government ministries partnered with volunteers to deliver humanitarian goods and medicine across the country.

On Wednesday, Graham filed a brief in court expanding on his argument that two calls he made to Georgia Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger after the election are protected by the US Constitution’s Speech or Debate Clause.,“The Constitution guarantees that a Senator ‘shall not be questioned’ about his protected ‘Speech or Debate’ -- and yet the District Attorney insists that Senator Graham must submit to questioning to ascertain whether he can be questioned or is immune from questioning,” Graham’s lawyer, Brian Lea of Jones Day, said in the filing. “That makes no sense.”,Fulton County District Attorney Fani Willis has argued that Graham’s testimony about the calls is crucial to the ongoing investigation and involves conduct that is beyond general protections shielding members of Congress from having to testify about their legislative activities.,Graham hasn’t been accused of wrongdoing.,US District Judge Leigh Martin May rejected that argument earlier this month, denying Graham’s motion to quash a subpoena and ordering him to testify. But an appeals court put the ruling on hold and referred the case back to May for additional arguments on whether the clause applies to his calls.,Raffensperger, who is also a Republican, has said the senator appeared to suggest in the calls that certain mail-in ballots could be discarded.,Willis has until Aug. 29 to respond to Graham’s filing. A phone call to her media line wasn’t picked up.,Graham argued in the filing that the phone calls were part of his broader investigation into the 2020 election to inform his vote under the Electoral Count Act. The senator, who ultimately voted to confirm President Joe Biden’s victory, said the phone calls also helped inform proposed legislation, making them “quintessentially protected legislative activity.”,Graham “had a right and duty to run down” allegations of voter fraud before deciding whether to certify Biden, he said.,(Updates with detail from the senator’s filing.),Most Read from Bloomberg Businessweek,©2022 Bloomberg L.P.",Lindsey Graham Makes Fresh Case for Avoiding Georgia Election Testimony,https://news.yahoo.com/lindsey-graham-makes-fresh-case-135718580.html

The nail technician has set up ...",Yahoo News,"On the 24 February 2022, Russian President Vladimir Putin launched a full-scale invasion of Ukraine, launching the biggest war in Europe since World War Two. Following the invasion, at least , have been displaced, with 5 million having fled Ukraine to find refuge in neighbouring countries. Seven million are thought to have been displaced in Ukraine itself. One Ukranian woman tells Cosmopolitan UK her story.,Even though we had heard Russian troops were moving towards the Ukrainian border, the invasion of Ukraine by Putin was hard to believe until it actually happened, the morning my sister rang. Myself and millions of others knew we had to get out. And fast.,I started packing our suitcases, eager to get myself and my two children, aged eight and five, out of danger’s way. My husband encouraged me to calm down, wait it out, and see what happened. I decided to heed his advice. Knowing food might become scarce, I walked, too afraid to drive, five minutes to the nearest supermarket to stock up on all the basics. Even very early in the morning, people were everywhere – long lines at the supermarket, the bank, the pharmacy.,In the days following the initial invasion, I continued working as a nail technician, earning money to save up for our impending departure from Dnipro, the city where we lived in the centre of the country. If a loud siren went off throughout the city alerting us of an imminent attack, I went into a windowless room for cover.,During the month I stayed in Ukraine after the invasion, most of my friends and family had escaped, fleeing both internally within Ukraine and to bordering countries. It was a scary time. We could often hear sirens, bombing, rockets. I tried very hard to make sure my children felt safe. They were my priority. ,Following the horrific news of the deaths that happened in Irpin, during on-the-ground battles, and in Bucha (where Russian forces massacred civilians), I started to ask my husband once again to leave Ukraine. He didn’t want to leave his country, he wanted to stay and fight for it.,There was one night, I can’t quite remember the date, when I heard explosions directly over our house. We took the children into the bathroom to sleep, afraid for the night ahead. It was this that made my husband decide we had to go, but he was going to stay behind.,I filled out my visa application forms on 1 April and by 4 April, the three of us used the money I had saved to take the first leg of our journey from Dnipro to the Polish border. I packed 2 suitcases and 3 bags to take with us. Mostly clothing and shoes, but I also decided to pack all my nail supplies in the hopes of working again once we’d settled.,The journey - made mostly via train - should have taken only 20 hours, but in the end it took about 60. We kept stopping, were told to turn off our phones in case the Russians picked up our signals, and we were made to keep lights off in case they could locate us in the dark. My kids thought it was a bit like a game. I was terrified.,When we finally arrived in Poland, we stayed with a family in the small village of Zalesie Gorna, 14 miles south of Warsaw, who had signed up for a scheme to support refugees. After over a month of being stuck inside in Ukraine, my kids could finally enjoy taking walks outside and breathing in the fresh air. Even though we were technically safe, I still could not completely rest as I could hear helicopters often flying overhead toward my country, toward my husband.,After eleven days of living being in Poland, we were given our UK visas and immediately started preparing for the journey to meet our longer-term sponsor family face-to-face in Newport, Wales.,As of 9 August 2022, at least , have been issued in the UK and 111,900 Ukrainians have arrived after fleeing the Russian invasion. Of those who have made it over to the UK, , have come as part of the ,, otherwise known as “Homes for Ukraine”. The scheme has allowed for those without relatives in the UK to come and live here for at least six months.,We boarded a train in Poland at 2am on 19 April and travelled from Zalesie Gorne to Warsaw. From Warsaw to Berlin. From Berlin to Cologne. From Cologne to Brussels. From Brussels to London. From London to Newport. Although my children napped, my eyes stayed wide awake, gazing at them, reflecting on all we had been through. At 1am, the doors of the train slid open, and we saw our sponsor, Emma*, who we had met previously on a video phone call, waiting for us. All I could think about was sleeping. That first night, I slept so deeply, knowing I was truly safe. Knowing my children were safe.,For the first few days, we just enjoyed getting to know Emma, her husband, and their three children – and their dog! Emma cooked for us at first, but then I asked if it was okay to make Ukrainian food for my children. She said I could use anything I wanted in the house, making me feel incredibly welcomed and loved, even though we were strangers.,I have since made their family some Ukrainian food – borscht and pancakes – but made sure Emma didn’t have any meat as she’s a vegetarian.,Although Emma and her family really do make me feel at home, deep down I know this is not my home until I have all my family with me. My husband and parents are still in Ukraine and I don’t know how long it will be before I see them again. I often watch the news on the TV or read it on my phone, learning about the horrors of war in my home country.,On 15 July, I read reports saying there had been rockets shot off directly behind our flats in Dnipro. I tried to phone my husband to check if he was okay, but he didn’t answer. I was physically shaking with fear, imagining something had happened to him. After an hour, he finally answered, calming me down and assuring me he was safe – that he had left his phone at home while he had been out.,In the first few weeks and months of the war, the international community poured out endless support for Ukrainian refugees. But now, I think people are starting to forget – the war is not yet over. We still need help. ,Since coming to Newport, my children have settled in so well at their primary school. They beg me not to come home because they love it so much, and even though their English wasn’t great to start with, it’s improving every day.,Back in the spring, I knew I wanted to start working again, but when I looked for part-time jobs that would accommodate school runs I couldn’t find anything in Newport. We had started getting Universal Credit, which helped with everyday finances, but I wanted to be able to save up to rent our own house. The only option was to become self-employed. I studied to get certified in the UK as a nail technician and found a place to rent in Newport to open my own salon. Although I don’t have many clients yet, I’m hoping word will get out and I’ll get more customers soon.,Every day, every single day, I am grateful the UK government didn’t leave my children and I in trouble. They accepted us, welcomed us. I’m forever thankful.,Since the invasion of Ukraine began six months ago, bloody fighting and attacks on civilians have led to at least ,. In Dnipro, Olena’s home city, a , on 15 July killed three and injured fifteen people. It isn’t the first time the city has been attacked. In March, the airport was ,, completely destroying it. Even now, there is no end in sight for the conflict in Ukraine. Russian troops have continued advancing through airstrikes and large-scale infantry attacks. Ukrainians have managed to fight back, much to the amazement of the West, not giving Russia an easy fight.

Hear the full conversation on the Yahoo Fantasy Football Forecast. Subscribe on Apple Podcasts, Spotify, Stitcher or wherever you listen.,[CROWD ROARING], I said I had Trey Lance number two in terms of guys that are gonna elevate his teammates. I firmly believe that, at least from-- you know, the passing volume might not be there, right, with Trey lance. But I just want to set the table with this, Dalton, that there's been a lot of panic about Trey Lance's accuracy, you know, what's he been doing in practice.,I think that we need to bake into the range of outcomes for all the pass catchers and for Trey Lance that Trey Lance just might come out there and be really, really good because this offense is a-- is a system that's brought, like, layups to quarterbacks throughout the entire course of the Kyle Shanahan-- you know, even back to Mike Shanahan run.,They're gonna give Trey Lance the layups from a system perspective, I think he'll take them when they're there. But he'll also bring deep shots to this team as well. So I just think that this Trey Lance thing could actually work out really well. You know, there was panic about Lamar Jackson. There was panic about Josh Allen, you know, all of these guys.,And you know, even-- I mean, Patrick Mahomes there wasn't as much panic about per se because the Chiefs at least were like, we love Patrick Mahomes, and he's lighting it up in practice. Everybody that watched him in practice, like, knew he was awesome, even if there was a couple reports about he's been throwing interceptions, that type of stuff.,So I don't want to say, like, that, you know, Trey Lance is gonna become those guys. I don't think he's gonna become Patrick Mahomes and, like, win the MVP in his second season or something like that. But there's a chance that he's just way better than people think., OK. So yeah, so there are some up and down practice reports that Trey Lance. As a 49ers fan, which we need to establish here first-- I'm a homer-- I'm choosing to believe it's because 'cause of their defense, which looks really, really strong on paper this year. So I bet on him in Vegas 50-to-1 to win the MVP. It's an MVP.,It's a quarterback award. All of the-- all the last winners have been MV-- have been quarterbacks of teams with the top two seeds in the League. And a lot of them-- half of those six winners have been odds 30-to-1 or greater. And he's taken over a team that led the League in yards per play last year, had a 10-point lead in the NFC Championship game, and had Nick Mullens, has the second most passing yards in NFL history over his first 16 games because of this situation and this coaching staff. And now imagine if Deebow, Aiyuk, and Kittle all stay healthy.,So yeah, I mean, there's a real chance that Lance is immediately good, both in fantasy, by the way, because he just runs so much. I mean, he led all quarterbacks in scrambles per drop back last year. And in real life, whether-- it's definitely gonna be some mistakes. Do you know that he has three starts since 2019? Three starts. I mean, it's almost 2023 right now. I mean, he's the seventh youngest starting quarterback ever.,But regardless, one thing is clear. This will be a different offense under Trey Lance compared to Jimmy Garoppolo. 45% of Lance's throws have traveled 10 yards or more beyond line of scrimmage. Just 32% of Garoppolo's did that. Deep throws, 20 yards are deeper. 10% more for Lance. So big, big difference there. It's really-- I mean, Aiyuk not only worked with him all offseason when Deebo was holding out for-- for the contract, but I mean, it's just also the area of the field in which Aiyuk runs his routes far more than Deebo Samuel.,So there will be-- and one other thing about Trey Lance and how is he gonna change the 49ers, while he is definitely a threat to take goal line touchdowns, overall Niners running backs had 5.2 yards per carry last year with Lance at quarterback. I mean, he is gonna create gape-- it's gonna part like the sea with that threat back there. And in this Shanahan, the holes are just gonna be wide open for whomever that running back is with Lance as the dual threat now calling-- calling hike.,A couple of things real quick. Not only is he inexperienced, but in his barely playing last year he suffered a knee sprain and he broke his finger. So maybe he turns out to be injury prone as well. But also, everyone made fun of his-- I'm not sure he throws a perfect spiral, but it absolutely cannot be underrated. I know it's an excuse, but cannot be underlooked that the dude had to change his entire throwing motion while dealing with this crazy broken finger that, like, rolled up on his knuckle and it just changed his mechanics. And that's what led to these dead arm rumors during the offseason.,But anyway, as you see behind me I have a commissioned art of Trey Lance and I'm wearing a shirt the, Trey Area. I'm a big believer if you haven't-- if you haven't got that by now.",Will this be a breakout season for Trey Lance in San Francisco?

Via AP news wire,2022-08-25T22:12:34.000Z,.A judge in Phoenix has ruled that an Arizona initiative expanding voting access and rolling back a host of restrictions enacted by the Republican-controlled...,Yahoo News,"A judge ruled Thursday that an , initiative expanding voting access and rolling back a host of restrictions enacted by the Republican-controlled Arizona Legislature and GOP Gov. Doug Ducey will be on the November ballot, barring a successful appeal to the state ,.,But backers of the Free and Fair Elections measure barely squeaked by after opponents succeeded in disqualifying more than 96,000 qualifying signatures.. That left the initiative with just 2,281 more than the required 237,645 signatures needed to make the ballot.,The ruling from Judge Joseph Mikitish came after three weeks of furious court action as backers of the election measure and two other initiatives tried to fend off challenges that the Legislature and Ducey have made far easier to win.,The Arizona Supreme Court issued rulings in all three measures Wednesday night that kept two of them on the ballot. If approved by the voters, they will require greater transparency for political spending and boost the amount of assets shielded from creditors.,The high court's ruling in the Free and Fair Elections case mainly rejected opponents' arguments over qualifying signatures, but several challenges to lower court rulings on signatures split for each side.,The court sent it to back to Maricopa County Superior Court judge Joseph Mikitish to consider those rulings and do the final math to determine if backers have enough signatures. He released that ruling at midday Thursday and ordered Secretary of State Katie Hobbs not to rescind her determination that the measure qualifies for the ballot.,The Arizona Free Enterprise Club, the pro-business group that challenged the initiative, is appealing the new ruling again.,Stacy Pearson, a spokeswoman for the group backing the initiative, said she doubts the court will intervene.,“Yes, there is still more more procedural hurdle, but if we were in the position to have to appeal that would just be performative rather than judicial,” Pearson said. “So we’re very confident the Supreme Court will (uphold) the fair ruling that was based on good law and good math.”,The Free and Fair Elections measure changes a slew of election laws. It specifically blocks the Legislature from overturning the results of presidential elections, an avenue some , explored after former President Donald Trump’s loss in the state in 2020.,It also guarantees ballot privacy and bars handing election materials or ballots over to outside groups like the state Senate did after 2020, expands voting access, mandates that all voters can go to any polling site, extends early voting and limits lobbyists ability to wine and dine lawmakers.,“The single most important component in this initiative is that it prevents the Legislature from overturning the results of an election,” Pearson said. “And, it prevents Cyber Ninjas in green shirts from spinning around ballots on Lazy Susan tables again, and making a mockery of Arizona’s extraordinarily safe and secure election process.”,The measure also would eliminate the “strict compliance” legal standard that led Mikitish to disqualify many of the petition sheets. The GOP-controlled Legislature required that standard for initiatives in 2017, making it easier to throw them out for relatively minor paperwork errors. Mikitish noted in an earlier ruling that it “requires nearly perfect compliance with constitutional and statutory mandates.',The Supreme Court's Wednesday evening rulings were the last word on a measure called the Predatory Debt Collection Protection Act backed by a California labor union and opposed by a new group organized by Arizona debt collection companies.,The initiative would raise the amount of a home’s value shielded from creditors under the “homestead exemption” from $150,000 to $400,000, and boost the value of vehicles, cash and other possessions shielded from creditors. It also caps interest rates on medical debts and adds yearly inflation adjustments.,The court also allowed a measure backed by former Arizona Attorney General Terry Goddard to be on the ballot, if the secretary of state certifies that is has enough valid signatures later Thursday, as appears likely. The Voters Right to Know Act will require any organization spending more than $5,000 on campaigns to identify all donors, with big penalties for failing to do so.,All three measures faced challenges to signatures based on paperwork errors made by paid circulators. But the most important challenge likely would have kept all three measures off the ballot. It argued that paid petition circulators needed to file affidavits certifying they legally can collect signatures with the secretary of state for each initiative they circulate.,Goddard and lawyers for all three measures said that election rules require them only for initial registrations, and even if they did not that the secretary of state's online portal only allows one affidavit top be filed.,A unanimous Supreme Court ruled that the certification must be provided for each measure. But Chief Justice Robert Brutinel wrote that throwing the initiatives off the ballot would impede the constitutional right of the people to write their own laws.,“A finding of non-compliance and disqualification of circulator signatures on this record and under these circumstances would “unreasonably hinder or restrict” the exercise of the initiative power under ... the Arizona Constitution,” Brutinel wrote.,Goddard, who has worked for years to get the political spending transparency measure on the ballot, applauded the ruling.,“Justice prevailed. I’m delighted,” Goddard said. “And they did what we hoped they would do, which is to say the logic says that there should have been an affidavit each time, but you can’t hold someone to a standard that it’s impossible to comply with.”",Ruling keeps Arizona voting access measure on the ballot,https://news.yahoo.com/ruling-keeps-arizona-voting-access-221234282.html

It certainly slows down the advance,” Shoigu told a meeting of the Shanghai Cooperation Organization (SCO) Wednesday, according to ,. “But we are doing it on purpose.”,Russian forces, however, have been hitting Ukrainian civilians from the beginning of the war, which Wednesday reached its six-month mark. In the early days of the war, Russia hit a ,, killing at least one ,. Since, Russia has hit playgrounds, theaters clearly marked as safeguarding children, office and apartment buildings, a ,.,Moscow has repeatedly denied it was behind the attacks, and has instead claimed it was “fake news,” or that the people dying from the attacks were crisis actors. Russia has even tried to place blame on Ukrainians and accused them of attacking their own people.,Shoigu’s bogus attempt at explaining Russia’s failings in the war in Ukraine come after a series of embarrassing news cycles for Russia, with a whole slew of explosions and attacks damaging a Russian air base in Crimea and a key supply bridge. According to a senior U.S. defense official, they come as the war has entered a new phase where Russia is really not making much progress at all.,“Right now, I would say that you are seeing a complete and total lack of progress by the Russians on the battlefield,” the senior U.S. defense official told reporters in a briefing last week. “We are at a different phase than... where we were even a couple of months ago.”,Shoigu's comments to brush off Russia’s battlefield problems also come in advance of an expected ,, which Russia seized early in the war.,There’s a whole host of other answers as to why Russia’s military may be having issues fighting the war besides the bald-faced lie that it is trying to avoid killing civilians. Russia’s military has encountered trouble from the get-go and has still not achieved its major objectives. Russian forces encountered logistics, planning, and fuel problems as they attempted to seize the capital, Kyiv, in the early days of the war. Russian troops waited in a ,, stalling for a week, before pulling back and resigning to regroup and deploy to other regions in Ukraine.,“Russia launched a full invasion of Ukraine six months ago, with the aim of toppling the government and occupying most of the country. By April, Russia’s leaders realized this had failed, and reverted to more modest objectives in eastern and southern Ukraine,” read a British intelligence assessment released Wednesday.,And even in regrouping to the east, efforts to take territory have only achieved “minimal” progress, according to the assessment.,To make matters, worse, morale is dragging among Russian forces, and munitions, vehicles, and personnel shortages abound, according to the intelligence assessment.,Some of Russia’s stumbling blocks can be attributed to their issues distributing resources and predicting warfighter needs in advance, according to the Institute for the Study of War.,“Russian forces had likely exhausted their momentum from territorial gains around Avdiivka and Bakhmut in Donetsk–a very small section of the whole Ukrainian theater–partially due to their inability to allocate sufficient resources to offensive ops,” the institute said Tuesday.,In other cases, Russian leaders are resorting to intimidation and threats to try to get soldiers fighting, ,.

They were called the “Facts First” spots and mostly involved people mistaking a banana for an apple.,“This is an apple,” one of the 60-second promos began, showing a plump red honeycrisp in front of a white backdrop as a piano tinkled a pensive tune. “Some people might tell you it’s a banana. They might scream ‘banana, banana, banana’ over and over again. They might put banana in all caps. You might even start to believe that this is a banana. But it’s not. This is an apple.”,It was a simple, elegant metaphor that said everything you need to know about the nightmare of cable news broadcasting during the Trump era.,But here we are, four years later, and CNN is upsetting its own apple cart, announcing a slew of editorial and programming changes that sound, frankly, kind of bananas. The network’s 2022 game plan? To lure a slew of new viewers by pivoting to the center. The news organization that Trump once called “the enemy of the people,” that he tried to ban from the White House press room, is even hoping to appeal to — get this — some Fox News viewers.,“In this age,” one former head of another news network predicted, “that strategy is doomed.”, ,Brian Stelter, who’d been tirelessly pushing back against Donald Trump’s “fake news” offensive and Fox News’ conspiracy-mongering for much of his nine-year stint as host of CNN’s “Reliable Sources,” is out. , Chris Wallace, the former Fox News star, is in, as the anchor of a shiny new Sunday night interview show at 7 p.m. ,. But you never know.,“This is a time of change and I know that is unsettling,” Christ Licht, CNN’s new CEO told CNN employees at an Aug. 19 staff meeting (he replaced Jeff Zucker when it was ,). “There will be more changes and you might not understand it or like it all.”,Licht seems like the kind of guy who doesn’t waste time; he’s already banished the ubiquitous “breaking news” banners that used to be part of the network’s on-air wallpaper and discouraged the use of,Others even higher up the corporate ladder have been hinting at further changes, including David Zaslav, the CEO of CNN’s parent company, Warner Bros. Discovery (since Warner Bros. and Discovery completed their $43 billion merger last April). He’s urged the network to tone down its political rhetoric and bring more conservative voices to the channel. “America needs a news network where everybody can come and be heard — Republicans [and] Democrats,” he told reporters at Allen & Co.’s Sun Valley gathering in July.,Granted, on paper, that strategy may have some merits. After all, the network’s current tactics aren’t exactly doing gangbusters. , although not catastrophically (CNN is projected to make $957 million this year, just a smidge below its 2022 profitability target of $1.1 million). ,, with CNN lagging behind MSNBC in viewership for the last 18 months, while CNN and MSNBC have both been trailing Fox News for years. Although, to be fair, CNN and MSNBC are fighting for the same blue-ish audience, while Fox has audiences in the red states all to itself., ,In any case, CNN has decided to pivot. And some folks think that’s a grand idea.,“The approach could be really smart,” NYU marketing professor Paul Hardart told TheWrap. “CNN was founded by Ted Turner as a straight news organization. It just sort of organically became the opposite of Fox. Moving back to what CNN was originally, I think that’s a reasonable strategy.”,Jon Klein, who headed CNN from 2004 to 2010, agreed – not surprising since middle of the road strategy this was the signature of his tenure leading the network. “It’s not only the best strategy to follow, it’s the only strategy,” he says. “When I was running the place, we had a very high percentage of viewers who would watch us and then go watch Fox. We shared a lot of viewers with MSNBC because they trusted us to tell them what’s going on. We had the highest ratings we ever had. The last time CNN beat Fox was the election year of 2008.”,Still, despite all that, there is one not-so-small hitch to CNN’s new straight-down-the-middle master plan: It’s not 2008 anymore.,Back then, when Klein’s CNN was on top, there were still two functioning political parties in America. You could put a Democrat and a Republican together on the same TV screen and the worst that would happen was a rousing ideological argument over whether the marginal tax rate should be 37% or 42%. Yes, there was some fringey craziness over health care death panels and whether Sarah Palin could see Russia from her house, but for the most part the center held. Sanity largely prevailed.,Today, though, sanity is in short supply. Once U.S. House members Liz Cheney and Adam Kinzinger depart elective office in January, exactly which Republicans in Congress will the new, inclusive CNN invite on its airwaves for a reasoned exchange of ideas? The one who thinks , and turn America into Sweden? Or the one , to cheat Trump out of a second term? How will CNN invite the “other side” on its airwaves when all that’s left of the other side often seems completely bonkers.,Even as a business plan, the idea of de-politicizing CNN seems like a lost cause. In the 14 years since 2008, cable news viewers have only hardened their silos. Hardly anyone bops from CNN to Fox News to MSNBC anymore, unless they’re forced to (,). The idea that CNN could lure hordes of Fox viewers by canceling “Reliable Sources” and chasing after some imaginary middle ground seems about as likely to succeed as , last spring. More likely, CNN will simply annoy its existing viewers and push them to MSNBC.,In this looking-glass political environment, where one side of the aisle (and cable dial) has decided it is no longer encumbered by facts or reality, there may be no center for CNN to pivot to. Except, maybe, for the one it already occupies.,“Most of us are there already, standing up for democracy, decency, covering the news,” one high-level network staffer told TheWrap. “Walter Cronkite — that’s what we’re trying to do.”,Breaking news: An apple is still an apple, not a banana., ",Is CNN’s Pivot to the Center a Smart Business Move or the Dumbest Idea Ever?,https://news.yahoo.com/cnn-pivot-center-smart-business-130000412.html

Gretchen Whitmer shows that jurors in a deeply divided nation can still reach agreement in...,Yahoo News,"TRAVERSE CITY, Mich. (AP) — The conviction of , shows that jurors in a deeply divided nation can still reach agreement in politically charged cases, according to experts.,But it leaves unanswered questions about the potential for violence by extremists with a vendetta against government and law enforcement, they say.,“I hope it will be a deterrent in the future, but we need to see some softening of the rhetoric before we can accurately predict that,” said Michael Edison Hayden, spokesman for the nonprofit Southern Policy Law Center, which monitors hate groups.,A federal jury in Grand Rapids, Michigan, returned guilty verdicts Tuesday against Adam Fox and Barry Croft Jr. on two counts of conspiracy. Two others in the plot, , pleaded guilty earlier. Franks' sentencing hearing is set for Oct. 6, Fox's for Dec. 12 and Croft's for Dec. 28. Garbin is serving a six-year term, but prosecutors Wednesday asked a judge to cut that to three due to his “remarkable” assistance to the government.,Prosecutors said they planned to grab Whitmer at her vacation home and blow up a bridge to stop police from responding.,A different jury in April deadlocked on Fox and Croft while acquitting two other men. That outcome prompted worries that the overheated political landscape was hampering jurors’ ability to put aside biases, particularly when the FBI — a frequent target of right-wing activists and commentators — was involved.,Some legal observers criticized the government’s handling of the case and questioned the wisdom of retrying it. Barbara McQuade, a former federal prosecutor, said refusing to do so would have been “the coward’s way out.”,“We’re seeing an escalation of threats of violence against public officials,” McQuade said. “The only way to stop that is by holding people accountable when they engage in acts like this, threatening to harm public officials.”,The case unfolded against a backdrop of nationwide polarization.,Whitmer, a rising Democratic star, had exchanged barbs with former President Donald Trump and was unpopular with conservatives, including over her policies early on during the COVID-19 pandemic.,Trump and other Republicans had accused the FBI of being a tool of Democrats. He described the Whitmer kidnapping plan as a “fake deal.” Jury selection in the retrial of Fox and Croft happened the day after federal agents searched Trump’s Mar-a-Lago estate for classified documents. During the trial, a man apparently angered by the search tried to breach the FBI’s Cincinnati office and was killed.,Even so, the jury in Michigan’s Western District — a blend of urban, suburban and rural areas representing a broad political spectrum — delivered “a real statement that citizens of our country aren’t going to put up with violent actions against public officials,” said Mark Chutkow, a former Detroit federal prosecutor.,Less clear is what, if any, effect the case will have on anti-government extremism and white-hot partisanship. Following the verdict, Whitmer renewed her call to “lower the temperature.”,“This is about every American who is serving the public, who’s dealing with threats, whether it’s an election worker or it is a police officer or a teacher,” she told reporters Wednesday after a back-to-school event in suburban Detroit. “This continued political rhetoric that is aimed at inspiring people to hurt their fellow Americans is dangerous.”,The convictions of Croft and Fox could be another rallying cry for far-right extremists, although likely not as potent as 1990s sieges in Waco, Texas, and Ruby Ridge, Idaho, said Jon Lewis, a research fellow with George Washington University’s program on extremism.,“It’s possible that individuals in anti-government spaces could leverage this as an example of continued tyranny, abuse of the rights of Americans,” Lewis said.,A more concerning outcome could be an increase in lone-wolf attacks as extremist groups become more wary of the potential for infiltration by undercover operatives, he said.,“It’s much harder with the lone actor,” Lewis said. “He doesn’t tell anyone his plans, he has legal access to firearms.”,The George Washington program is tracking cases against 49 people charged with “offenses related to the boogaloo movement,” a loose confederation of believers in a second civil war, he said.,Far-right paramilitary groups were gleeful about the first trial’s outcome and probably are unhappy with the convictions, said Mark Pitcavage, senior research fellow with the Anti-Defamation League’s Center on Extremism. But history suggests guilty verdicts are less likely to incite violent reactions than arrests perceived as unjust, he said.,It’s equally doubtful that the case will bring about a calmer tone in politics, Pitcavage said.,“We’re in such a heavily polarized society right now and few people seem to want to step back from the brink,” he said.,The most significant ripple effect, he said, might be what was avoided: another defeat and further damage to the FBI’s credibility.,Neama Rahmani, a former federal prosecutor in California who has followed the Michigan case and criticized the government’s performance in the first trial, said the convictions vindicated the bureau’s investigation.,“Obviously there are folks who are always going to distrust the FBI,” he said. “But this is a big win.”,The convictions may boost public understanding of the FBI’s tactics in combating domestic terrorism, particularly use of undercover operatives, said Dennis Lormel, president of the Society of Former FBI Agents.,“I understand the concerns about overreaching, especially with the rhetoric about the FBI being politicized,” Lormel said. “But the opportunity to insert FBI employees or cooperating witnesses is critically important. If we lose that, we will be in a lot of trouble, we’ll see more terrorist attacks.”,___,Associated Press reporters Mike Householder in Novi, Michigan, and Ed White in Detroit contributed to this story.",Whitmer kidnap plot convictions unlikely to curb extremism,https://news.yahoo.com/whitmer-kidnap-plot-convictions-unlikely-174230876.html

Two men were acquitted in that trial and the jury deadlocked on charges against Fox and Croft Jr., triggering a mistrial that prompted the government to try again.,The historic case ends with four men going to prison and two others going free, two years after the FBI arrested all six on federal charges they plotted to kidnap the governor from her vacation home out of anger over her lockdown orders and mask mandates, and blow up a bridge near her home to slow down law enforcement. Five defendants were arrested in an FBI sting outside an Ypsilanti warehouse, where prosecutors said the men thought they were going to make a down payment on explosives, pick up free military gear, and then head to Buffalo Wild Wings for free beer and chicken. But it was all a ruse.,Croft was arrested at a gas station in New Jersey. Eight more individuals face , in the case.,""This verdict brings important accountability for perpetrators of violence against public officials,"" said former U.S. Attorney for the Eastern District of Michigan Barbara McQuade. ""Bringing these plotters to justice will cause others to think twice before engaging in similar conduct in the future."",McQuade applauded federal prosecutors in Grand Rapids for ""having the courage"" to retry the case, saying:,""It would have been easy for them to simply move on to the next case to avoid the possible embarrassment of a second mistrial or acquittal,"" McQuade said. ""But instead, they fulfilled their duty to protect the public."",Neither Fox nor Croft had any discernible reaction as U.S. District Judge Robert Jonker read the verdicts, both staring forward and occasionally leaning over to speak to their attorneys. Fox's mother, who attended every day of the retrial, shook her head as Jonker read the verdict.,The defense long argued that this was a case of entrapment, that the defendants were merely tough-talking potheads who were venting about their government, and that rogue FBI agents and informants set them up.,""We will most certainly appeal,"" Fox's lawyer, Christopher Gibbons, said after the verdict. ""Obviously, there was controversy in the trial."",The defense raised numerous issues during the trial, creating some tense moments in the courtroom. Defense attorneys accused the judge of , by repeatedly cutting them off during questioning, calling their arguments ""crap,"" and setting time limits only on the defense attorneys — telling them they could only take as much time to question witnesses as the prosecution.,The defense also took issue with the judge's handling of a, for alleged misconduct on the second day of trial. That juror allegedly told co-workers that his or her mind was made up about the case from the get-go, and was excited to be on the jury.,The judge dealt with the issue privately in his chambers, not allowing either the prosecution or the defense to be part of the proceeding.,""I think justice should happen in public,"" Croft's lawyer, Joshua Blanchard, said while leaving the courthouse Tuesday.,Blanchard had made a filing regarding the potentially problematic juror, and asked the judge to unseal it after the verdict — but Jonker said that will be explored in the future.,Throughout the trial, the prosecution argued the men did a lot more than talk — they took action to carry out their plan, including casing Whitmer's vacation home twice, building explosives, holding secret meetings, and practicing breaking-and-entering drills in shoot-houses they built that mimicked her cottage.,In the end, the jury sided with the government, delivering a major victory not only to the prosecutors, but to the FBI, whose reputation came under assault during both trials, with the defense repeatedly blasting agents and informants, calling them liars and manipulators with overreaching powers.,""The defendants in this case believed that their antigovernment views justified violence. Today's verdict is a clear example that they were wrong in that assessment,"" said Special Agent in Charge David Porter, who oversees the FBI office in Grand Rapids.,As lawyers left the room, U.S. Attorney for the Western District of Michigan Andrew Birge shook assistant prosecutor Nils Kessler's hand. Kessler, the lead prosecutor for both trials, urged the jury before it went into deliberations to remember one thing: that four men cased Whitmer's house in the middle of the night with guns, and planned to build a bomb.,Kessler drove this point home repeatedly during closing in what experts believed to be the strongest piece of evidence against the defendants: the surveillance trips, which jurors got to see for themselves. Prosecutors played video of the men driving by Whitmer's cottage on a rainy night, and audio recordings of Fox scoping out the cottage during a daytime surveillance excitedly stating: ""That's it. Dude, that's it. Turn around."",""The verdict confirms this plot was very serious, very dangerous and posed a threat not only to the governor personally, but also to innocent bystanders,"" Birge said.,The jury spent two weeks listening to testimony from FBI agents, informants and wiretapped conversations of the defendants themselves, in which they discussed kidnapping ""that tyrant bitch"" and trying her ""for treason."",Fox, the accused ringleader, was also heard telling an undercover FBI informant: ""'We’re gonna kidnap the bitch. We need a seven- to eight-member team. We’re gonna go up to her house and take a look at it ... and we’re going as low-profile tourists, pure Michigan bro.'"",Former U.S. Attorney Matthew Schneider, who has been closely following the case, said the prosecution learned a big lesson from the first trial and it's ""clear they changed their strategy"" to focus on what the defendants did before ever meeting FBI informants.,""However, the prosecution isn't out of the woods yet,"" said Schneider, who believes the judge's handling of the case, such as limiting defense lawyers' time limits to cross-examine witnesses, may give the defense grounds for appeal.,""The judge's ruling to severely limit the defense from cross-examining witnesses will be the No. 1 issue on appeal,"" Schneider said. ""I would not be surprised if this case gets reversed on appeal because of how the judge prevented the defendants from cross-examining the witnesses. Then we could see a third trial."",Prominent criminal defense attorney Mike Rataj, who represented one of the defendants in the failed , a decade ago, expressed similar concerns.,""The judge wanted this case over and done with really fast, and he got his wish,"" said Rataj, who believes the time limits imposed only on the defense raise due process issues.,Rataj also has issues with the judge's handling of the potentially problematic juror, arguing the defense and prosecution should have been allowed to participate in the inquiry of the juror.,""That's certainly going to be a centerpiece issue for appeal ... that’s certainly something they can hang their hat on,"" Rataj said of the defense, noting he was also perturbed at the jury selection process.,The jury was picked in one day. The judge did all the voir dire — or questioning — and gave both sides only 15 minutes to ask questions during the whole process.,""I said it before — it was rushed,"" Rataj said. ""And It seemed to me that the judge wanted this case over and done with in short order. I'm sorry. When people are facing life in prison, that's not the way a federal trial is supposed to be conducted.""","Jury convicts Adam Fox, Barry Croft Jr. in Whitmer kidnapping plot",https://news.yahoo.com/jury-convicts-adam-fox-barry-161018466.html

But this time around they can expect a degree of pre-pandemic normalcy. That is because the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recently issued , that loosen virus protocols and leave much of the decision making to families, schools and local officials.,The new federal guidance, ,, “acknowledges that the pandemic is not over,” but it allows Americans to decide what their own level of risk is and how they choose to mitigate that risk.,Yahoo News,spoke to Dr. Michael Chang, pediatric infectious diseases specialist at UTHealth Houston and Children’s Memorial Hermann Hospital, on questions that people may have about,the new CDC guidelines and how COVID-19 protocols have changed this school year.,Chang told Yahoo News that the decision to change COVID-19 protocols in schools stems from the knowledge that scientists and health experts now have about how the virus affects children.,“Overall, you know, we can say that children seem less likely to have severe illness and hospitalization,” Chang said. He noted,that some children do develop long COVID and need hospitalization but said the CDC recommendations “make sense.”,He added, “I think they're trying to give guidance for families to make their own kind of individualized and family decisions for what works best for them, in this context of having the lower risk of severe illness and hospitalization for most people.”,Dr. Greta Massetti, the CDC’s chief field epidemiologist, who announced the changes to the agency’s COVID-19 guidance on Aug. 11, said the decision took into account where we are in the pandemic right now.,“High levels of population immunity due to vaccination and previous infection, and the many tools that we have available to protect people from severe illness and death, have put us in a different place,” Massetti said, adding that based on the latest data, around 95% of the population now has some level of immunity due to to vaccination, previous infection or a combination of both.,This year parents can expect that their children will not need to be routinely tested for COVID-19 to stay in school.,The CDC is no longer recommending routine screenings unless the school is located in a community that Is experiencing high levels of COVID-19 spread. For schools in areas where community transmission levels are high, the CDC recommends that these institutions consider implementing screening tests for high-risk activities such as close-contact sports, band or theater, as well as before or after large events such as prom, tournaments and group travel, and when students and staff return to school from breaks such as holidays.,One of the most significant changes in the updated CDC guidance is that the agency is no longer recommending home quarantines to students and school staff who are exposed to the virus but don't have symptoms.,Even if they come into contact with someone infected with COVID-19, students or staff who have no symptoms can continue to attend school as long as they wear a high-quality mask for 10 days and get tested after the fifth day. This recommendation applies for those who are both vaccinated and unvaccinated.,If someone does have symptoms and they test positive, Chang said they obviously should stay at home and isolate.,According to the ,, anyone who tests positive and has symptoms should isolate at home for at least five days. If symptoms improve after the fifth day and the person has no fever for 24 hours without the use of medications to reduce that fever, the agency says the individual can exit isolation without the need to test again. That person should still,wear a mask for 10 days after the onset of symptoms, according to the agency.,Chang, however, disagrees with the no-test-to-exit-isolation strategy. “As a pediatric infectious disease person, I would still recommend that if your child tests positive, or anyone in your family were to test positive, those people really should have negative tests before exiting isolation,” he said.,One reason Chang and , advise people to test before exiting isolation is that , have shown people can still be contagious after being sick with COVID-19 for five,days.,Finally, based on the new CDC guidance, schools will also likely be ending a method called cohorting, designed to minimize COVID-19 exposure by keeping students in the same group throughout the day.,The CDC recommends universal indoor masking in schools located in areas where COVID-19 community transmission levels are high. According to the agency’s ,, about 34% of counties in the U.S. have high levels of transmission.,Chang says that now more than ever, it is important for parents to follow local trends in virus outbreaks in order to decide on their own level of risk and whether their children should continue to wear a mask in school.,“Each family and parent will have to think about their individual family's risk,” Chang said. “Do they have high-risk individuals in their household? Is someone, say a grandparent with heart disease, living with them? In which case, they would want to be more cautious about continuing to wear masks, continuing to have some physical distance, and still limit high-risk indoor activities.”",Expert explains the CDC's new COVID guidance for schools,https://news.yahoo.com/expert-explains-the-cd-cs-new-covid-guidance-for-schools-165908063.html

The teams worked together for about half the day.,Here's what stood out:,The offense struggled, particularly in the two-minute drill at the end of practice. On its first drive, the first-team offense couldn’t reach midfield. Rookie Kyle Philips – targeted four times in the series, including a catch – took a big hit at the end, as quarterback Ryan Tannehill tried to squeeze a ball to him between two defenders.,Tannehill was picked off in the end zone by Cardinals cornerback Byron Murphy in the starters’ second drive. Cody Hollister was the targeted receiver.,Cardinals safety Tae Daley, who played at Vanderbilt from 2017-19, also had an interception returned for a touchdown off rookie quarterback Malik Willis in the two-minute period.,Tannehill said the Cardinals’ defense was showing looks the Titans looks they haven’t seen before, including some not normally seen in the NFL.,“We just weren’t playing at a high level, what we expect offensively,” Tannehill said. “Just too inconsistent for today. We have to learn from it, clean it up. They were throwing a lot of different looks at us we really didn’t prepare for. We were just coming out for a half practice with (the Cardinals). It will be good learning tape.”,The offense wasn’t as full strength, too. Wide receiver Robert Woods was limited and first-round pick Treylon Burks left practice shortly after a special team periods, where he was returning punts.,Willis had arguably his best performance with the Titans. He threw with timing and accuracy, especially in 7-on-7 work, where he completed all seven of his passes.,His best play of the day: a deep completion to a falling Mason Kinsey in a Titans vs. Titans team period. The ball sailed at least 40 yards. It drew some of the loudest cheers of the day from fans.,The former Liberty star also hit Reggie Roberson in stride across the middle in a team drill, a play that looked like his completion to wide receiver Nick Westbrook on his first play of the preseason game against the Tampa Bay Buccaneers last Saturday.,Willis wasn’t without his mistakes – the pick, for example – but he showed “improved” play Wednesday, according to coach Mike Vrabel.,“I thought there was some good timing,” Vrabel said. “Something that came up (Tuesday): Against zone, how quickly that ball needs to be delivered and where it needs to go. I thought that there were some accurate balls standing where I was in 7-on-7.”,Titans cornerback Caleb Farley had a strong one-on-one rep against Cardinals star receiver DeAndre Hopkins, running step for step and breaking up a pass to the three-time All Pro.,“It’s extremely beneficial to be able to work with guys that have proven to be elite players in the NFL,” Farley said. “And then to be able to make plays on them, it’s a good confidence booster and some motivation to keep pushing and working hard going in the right direction.”,But Hopkins also showed why he’s one of the NFL’s best wideouts. He caught a pass off a slant, despite strong coverage from Titans cornerback Kristian Fulton, and scored a touchdown on second-round rookie Roger McCreary in one-on-ones. In a low red zone two-on-two drill, Hopkins also had an impressive one-handed grab in the end zone with Fulton in coverage.,Star running back Derrick Henry was the most active he’s been in practice since the start of training camp, participating in 7-on-7 and team periods. Henry said last week he typically ramps up in the last week of the preseason, which the Titans are now in.,Vrabel said he feels Henry is in a good spot.,“Derrick wants to be as involved as possible, you know?"" Vrabel said. ""We have open dialogue. He’s been great. He’s been all for whatever it is we decide is best for him and the team.”,Defensive lineman Denico Autry, right guard Nate Davis, nickelback Elijah Molden and linebacker Dylan Cole were among the Titans to not practice.

The attack between Aug. 24-26, 2012 saw militants essentially hunting down civilians door-to-door, killing indiscriminately, and leaving a wake of carnage.,One witness told the investigators, “Everyone was screaming, saying, ‘Save this person or he will die.’ Entering the hospital meant that you were going to see people dying.”,“I still remember the people’s cries; everyone was calling the name of their loved one … I remember wondering whether some people were dead or alive because they had stopped screaming,” the witness said.,Another witness from a hospital remembered the vivid color of death. “The hospital floor, which had been white, became entirely red from blood,” the witness told the investigators. “We tried to mop it a little just to remove the red color.

Some were slaughtered, including by machetes. Most were killed by gun fire, a few were burned.”,Many of the survivors said they cooperated with investigators writing the report to make sure the slaughter is not forgotten. “It is very important for our children to learn our history,” one woman survivor said. “Maybe future generations can learn from what happened to us. There are more of those who we love laid in the ground than living above it.”,Though the attack happened a decade, and several other battles ago, including the Taliban’s retaking of Afghanistan and Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, the report is widely seen as crucial documentation of an atrocity committed under Assad, who is still enjoying power.,Attempts to bring his regime in front of a U.N. tribunal are consistently vetoed by Russia and China for obvious reasons. “There is no doubt that the August 2012 Daraya assault remains a sorrowful event in the collective memories of victims and witnesses,” the report states. “This report documents these collective experiences to be kept as a historical record, with the hope that justice will one day be served.”",Survivors of Syrian Massacre Beg World Not to Forget Assad’s War Crimes,https://news.yahoo.com/survivors-syrian-massacre-beg-world-114555213.html

And still, I do not believe it’s possible to know the full extent of the defendants’ intentions or abilities.,But I do know that violent threats and plots need to be treated seriously – especially those that focus on specific people and their supposed tyranny.,It will also be important to observe how militias and related groups respond to these convictions: Claims that the judicial process was corrupt have already surfaced, which could fuel , as the nation heads into midterm congressional elections.,In 2020, , indicated the Wolverine Watchmen had split off from the larger ,, which had featured prominently in an April 2020 Michigan , that garnered national attention.,The Wolverine Watchmen appear to be a type of militia called “millenarian,” which tends to be dangerous, secretive, , and anti-government. This is in contrast with the other type of militia unit – “constitutionalist” – whose members still train with firearms but take a much more defensive, rather than offensive, stance toward the government.,The exact cause of the split is not clear, but I have witnessed in my work that fractures are exceedingly common in militia groups because of personality conflicts or disputes over a group’s goals and plans, as well as whether their actions are private or in public.,In a similar vein, it also appears that Adam Fox, the plot’s alleged mastermind, had been , of yet another militia group called the Michigan Home Guard before joining the Watchmen.

However, in my experience, militia members hold a complex array of personal beliefs, including support for racial equality that is sincere even if , about the full scope of modern racism.,Questions remain among some militia members and their supporters about the seriousness of the Watchmen’s plot. At the time of their arrests, militia members who knew some of the defendants , their ability to actually execute the complicated plan.,While I continue to hear disparaging remarks about Croft and Fox in particular, most of the skeptical focus has since shifted to the integrity of the investigation.,The defense team in the original trial argued the plot was actually the creation of , involved in the investigation.

Secretary-General Antonio Guterres has called for a “Summit of the Future” next year and Zelenskyy said it would be symbolic to hold it in Ukraine, because “it is on the territory of Ukraine that the world’s future is decided, whether we will have a future at all.”,Zelenskyy spoke by video over objections from Russia’s U.N. ambassador, Vassily Nebenzia, who said council rules require leaders to be present in the council chamber at U.N. headquarters in New York to deliver a speech. He said the Ukrainian leader already had been allowed to give video addresses on two previous occasions because of special circumstances and should not be allowed a third time.,The overwhelming majority of the 15-member council disagreed — 13 countries voted in favor of another video speech by Zelenskyy, Russia voted against it and China abstained.,Guterres called the six-month anniversary of the Russian invasion “a sad and tragic milestone,” with no end in sight to the war.,He pointed to thousands of civilian casualties, grave violations of international human rights and humanitarian law, millions of Ukrainians who have lost their homes and are displaced or refugees, and rapidly rising humanitarian needs as winter approaches.,“The consequences of this senseless war are being felt far beyond Ukraine,” Guterres said. “We are seeing new vulnerabilities emerge in a global environment already worn out by conflicts, inequality, pandemic-induced economic and health crises, and climate change — with a disproportionate impact on developing countries.”,Guterres warned that the acceleration of already high food, fertilizer and energy prices “has triggered a global crisis that could drive millions more into extreme poverty.”,U.S. Ambassador Linda Thomas-Greenfield addressed Zelenskyy, saying the United States stands with Ukraine “today and every day, and every Russian bomb that falls only strengthens our resolve to support your sovereignty and your independence."",Six months after the invasion, she said, “Russia's goal is as clear as ever: to dismantle Ukraine as a geopolitical entity and erase it from the world map."",Nebenzia again blamed “the Kyiv regime” that came to power in 2014 — the year Russia invaded and annexed Crimea — for what many council members called “the catastrophic consequences"" of six months of hostilities.,To Western nations claiming Russia is threatening Ukrainian independence, Nebenzia said, “the only threat to the independence of Ukraine is the current government of Kyiv,” which he claimed makes no major decision without consulting Western advisers.,He also accused Ukraine's government of suppressing the opposition, persecuting people for reading Russian language news, and imprisoning them for accepting humanitarian aid from Russia.,After the meeting, Ukrainian Ambassador Sergiy Kyslytsya read a statement on behalf of 55 countries and the European Union denouncing Russia for its “unprovoked full-scale and illegal invasion” and deploring its failure to comply with U.N. General Assembly resolutions calling for an immediate halt to its use of force against Ukraine.,With diplomats from many of the countries standing alongside, the statement read by Kyslytsa reaffirmed their solidarity with Ukraine, condemned Russian missile strikes that have killed civilians and destroyed civilian buildings, and reiterated their demand for an immediate cease-fire and withdrawal of Russian forces.,Nebenzia was asked by a reporter if the media would be back for a one-year anniversary.,“I’m no fortuneteller,” he replied.",Ukraine leader: The world's future being decided in Ukraine,https://news.yahoo.com/ukraine-leader-worlds-future-being-205907801.html
